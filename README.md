# dat_file_processor
A Simple GUI Tool that accepts a folder filled with large .DAT files, removes duplicate rows of data from every .DAT file and then returns a folder with the resultant .DAT files.
This code is useful for the defence sector, especially when antennas and radars capture hoards of data and this data is to be converted to information for some use.
